# Documentation Page

## Project Description

This project is a sample documentation page. Please do not take the actual content of the documentation page seriously. Instead, consider it to be filler text.

The content and the navigation bar of the webpage are responsive so that it may be presentable on all devices regardless of their screen width. This responsiveness was achieved through the use of media queries.

This webpage also implements a dark mode feature. This feature allows the user to alternate between a dark and light mode by clicking the moon or sun icon contained within the webpage. This feature was implemented through the use of JavaScript.

## Credits

This project was created by just me. The idea for this project came from the freeCodeCamp responsive web design course.
